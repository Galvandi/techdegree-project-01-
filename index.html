        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm a 26 year old guy that is determined to become a Web Developer by the end of 2019.</p>
      </header>

      <h3>Learning to code</h3>
      <p>I've discovered programming as a hobby in 2015. It was a frustrating process, but also extremely satisfying
        to see ideas take shape.</p>
      <p>First I learned Blueprint Visual Scripting, which is a programming method that is used by the game engine <abbr title="Unreal Engine 4">UE4</abbr>
        It was a great way to get familiar with programming concepts. Soon after that I learned the basics of C++ and
        was able to create some quite complex game mechanics inside UE4</p>
      <p><strong>But</strong> Outside UE4, I never got beyond C++ console applications. I had the desire to create
        something more than that...</p>
      <h3>Diving into Web Development</h3>
      <p>JavaScript is a quirky language that looked familiar, didn't require compilation and ran directly in the
        browser. I loved it!</p>
      <p>Functional programming, hoisting, execution contexts, closures, prototypal inheritance, even though Javascript
        looked familiar there were, and still are, alot of interesting new things to learn.</p>
      <p>As for HTML and CSS... I struggle with it the most. And that, is exactly the reason why I choose Treehouse's
        Front-End Web Developer Techdegree.</p>

      <h3>Work related Goals</h3>
      <p>Even though I'm familiar with some of these things, I lack practical experience. I need to work on real-world projects and collaborate with other people to get better.</p>
